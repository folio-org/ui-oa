Created by Peter Murray, last modified on Aug 09, 2021

FOLIO is developed and used by people from all over the world who have a broad set of skills, personalities, and experiences.  We represent libraries, service providers and independent contributors, and our diversity of perspectives is essential to our prosperity as a project.  We are committed to ensuring that the FOLIO community is a safe, enjoyable, and thriving environment for everyone.

The purpose of a Code of Conduct is to protect members of a community from harm in that community’s spaces.  As a community, we expect participants to act according to the following ground rules so that people with different perspectives and communication styles can work together on the FOLIO project effectively, productively, and respectfully—even in the face of disagreements. Ground rules ensure that everyone within the community is clear about the behavior that is expected of them and that newcomers know what kind of environment they can expect to find.  We use the Contributor Covenant (version 1.4.1) as our guide.

If you encounter unacceptable behavior in chat, on mailing lists, at meetings or events, or in any other channel, contact conduct-report@folio.org or through the anonymous web form.
Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors, maintainers, and users of the system pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of ability, age, body size, education, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, sex characteristics, sexual identity, sexual orientation, or socioeconomic status.
Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include but are not limited to:

    Using welcoming and inclusive language
    Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
    Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
    Focusing on what is best for the community
    Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include but are not limited to:

    The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
    Racist, violent, or other offensive language
    Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
    Bullying by not listening to all voices, aggressively talking over someone, or ignoring some voices in the debate
    Public or private harassment
    Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
    Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

Conflict Resolution

The FOLIO open source project relies on discussion, disagreements, and respectful debate. We aim to empower individuals to first resolve conflicts themselves, asking for help when needed. (For example, from SIG conveners, technical leads, and members of the Product, Technical, and Community councils.)  Conflict resulting in unacceptable behavior is not permitted and is a violation of the FOLIO project code of conduct. 
Our Responsibilities

The FOLIO Community Council is responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and is expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

The FOLIO Community Council has the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.
Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and it also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by the FOLIO Community Council.
Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting Community Support Volunteers (CSVs) at conduct-report@folio.org or through the anonymous web form. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The CSVs are obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.  The FOLIO Community Support Volunteers are:

    Ian Walls
    Jenn Colt
    Laura Daniels
    Peter Murray
    Sharon Wiles-Young
    Stephanie Buck 

CSVs who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the Community Support Volunteers.

For details on the enforcement process, see the Code of Conduct Process document.
